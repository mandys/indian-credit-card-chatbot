# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Setup Guide - Persistent Data Storage

## ⚠️ **Critical Issue**: Data Persistence on Streamlit Cloud

**Problem**: Every time you deploy to Streamlit Cloud, all JSON files get overwritten → **All user feedback and analytics data is LOST**

**Solution**: Use external storage that persists across deployments.

---

## 🔧 **Option 1: GitHub Gist Storage (Recommended - Free & Simple)**

### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Gist**
1. Go to https://gist.github.com/
2. Create a new gist with filename `feedback_data.json`
3. Add initial content: `[]`
4. Create gist and copy the Gist ID from URL

### **Step 2: Create GitHub Token**
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with `gist` scope
3. Copy the token

### **Step 3: Add to Streamlit Secrets**
In your Streamlit Cloud dashboard:
```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_your_token_here"
GIST_ID = "your_gist_id_here"
```

### **Step 4: Deploy**
✅ Your data will now persist across all deployments!

## 🔧 **Option 2: Session State Only (Temporary)**

If you don't set up external storage:
- ⚠️ Data persists during user session only
- ❌ All data lost when app redeploys
- 💡 Good for testing, bad for production

---

## 🔧 **Option 3: Custom HTTP Storage**

If you have your own API endpoint:
```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
STORAGE_ENDPOINT = "https://your-api.com"
STORAGE_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
```

## 📊 **How Self-Learning Works After Setup**

### **Data Collection (Automatic)**
```
Every user interaction:
📝 Question asked → Analytics captured
👍👎 Feedback given → Pattern recorded
💾 Data saved to persistent storage
```

### **Weekly Analytics (Manual Review)**
```
1. Run: streamlit run analytics_dashboard.py
2. Review trending queries and satisfaction rates
3. Identify low-performing responses
4. Update card data or QA logic as needed
```

### **Continuous Improvement Cycle**
```
Week 1: 📊 Collect baseline data
Week 2: 📈 Identify trending topics  
Week 3: 🔧 Fix low-satisfaction responses
Week 4: 📊 Measure improvement
Repeat: 🔄 Continuous learning cycle
```

## 🎯 **Expected Self-Learning Results**

### **Month 1**: Foundation
- 100+ feedback entries collected
- Basic trending patterns identified
- Performance baseline established

### **Month 2**: Intelligence  
- Smart follow-up questions working
- Poor responses flagged automatically
- Seasonal patterns emerging

### **Month 3**: Optimization
- 90%+ satisfaction rate achieved
- Proactive improvements based on trends
- Fully intelligent conversation flow

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Data Security**
- Feedback contains user queries (no personal data)
- GitHub Gist is public - consider private gist for sensitive data
- Analytics data helps improve experience, no privacy issues

### **Performance**
- External storage adds ~200ms per feedback save
- Analytics dashboard loads data once, then caches
- Minimal impact on user experience

### **Monitoring**
- Check analytics dashboard weekly
- Monitor satisfaction rates monthly
- Review trending topics for content updates

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Data Not Persisting**
1. Check Streamlit secrets are set correctly
2. Verify GitHub token has `gist` permissions  
3. Check Gist ID is correct
4. View app logs for storage errors

### **Slow Performance**
1. External storage can add latency
2. Consider caching for heavy loads
3. Monitor storage API rate limits

### **Analytics Not Working**
1. Ensure pandas/plotly installed in requirements.txt
2. Check analytics files are being generated
3. Verify storage permissions

---

## ✅ **Setup Verification**

Test your setup:
1. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud with secrets configured
2. Ask a question and give feedback  
3. Redeploy the app
4. Check if feedback persists in analytics dashboard

✅ **Success**: Data persists across deployments
❌ **Failed**: Data resets on redeploy → Check secrets configuration
