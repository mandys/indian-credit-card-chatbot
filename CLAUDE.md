# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is an Indian credit card comparison chatbot that helps users compare features between Axis Bank Atlas and ICICI Bank Emeralde Private Metal credit cards. The system uses a **pure AI-powered QA engine** (Gemini preferred, OpenAI fallback) for intelligent responses, replacing the previous regex-based intent detection system.

## 🚨 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS!

### Research → Plan → Implement
**NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!** Always follow this sequence:
1. **Research**: Explore the codebase, understand existing patterns, review test cases
2. **Plan**: Create detailed implementation plan with validation checkpoints
3. **Implement**: Execute the plan with testing and validation

When asked to implement any feature, always say: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

### Quality Gates - ALL MUST PASS ✅
**MANDATORY CHECKS BEFORE ANY COMMIT:**
```bash
# Run all quality checks
python -m pytest tests/ -v                # All tests must pass
python -m black --check .                 # Code formatting
python -m flake8 .                        # Linting
python test_runner.py                     # Project-specific tests (21 comprehensive test cases)
```

**ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**: Fix ALL issues before continuing. No exceptions.

## Code Quality Standards

### FORBIDDEN - NEVER DO THESE:
- **NO hardcoded API keys** - use environment variables
- **NO time.sleep()** in production code - use proper async patterns
- **NO** keeping old and new code together
- **NO** migration functions or compatibility layers
- **NO** versioned function names (processV2, handleNew)
- **NO** TODOs in final code
- **NO** print() statements in production - use proper logging

### Required Standards:
- **Delete** old code when replacing it
- **Meaningful names**: `user_query` not `query`, `card_data` not `data`
- **Early returns** to reduce nesting
- **Type hints** everywhere: `def process_query(query: str) -> dict:`
- **Proper error handling**: Use try/except with specific exceptions
- **Docstrings** for all functions and classes
- **Consistent formatting**: Use Black for code formatting

### Python-Specific Rules:
- **Use f-strings** for string formatting, not .format() or %
- **List comprehensions** over loops when appropriate
- **Context managers** for file operations and API calls
- **Proper exception handling** with specific exception types
- **Logging** instead of print statements
- **Environment variables** for configuration (never hardcode)

## Financial Calculation Logic

### Intent Categories
- `reward_calculation` - "What points for ₹50k spend on dining?"
- `redemption_query` - "What can I do with 5000 points?"
- `feature_comparison` - "Compare lounge access between cards"
- `general_query` - Basic card information requests

### Currency Preprocessing
- "3L" → 300,000
- "2 crore" → 20,000,000  
- "20k" → 20,000
- Handles Indian lakh/crore notation

### Reward Calculation Engine
- Category-specific earning rates with caps
- Tiered earning (e.g., Axis travel: 5x up to ₹2L monthly, then 2x)
- Exclusion handling for restricted categories
- Comparative analysis across cards

## Data Structure Standards

### Unified JSON Field Mapping
Both cards normalized to have consistent fields:
- `rate_general` - Base earning rate for general spends
- `value_per_point` - Redemption value per point/mile
- `accrual_exclusions` - Array of excluded categories
- `earning_rate` - Dynamically created unified rate field

### Key Card Data Points
**Axis Atlas:**
- 2 EDGE Miles per ₹100 general spend
- 5x miles for travel (up to ₹2L monthly cap, then 2x)
- Education NOT excluded
- ₹1 per EDGE Mile redemption value

**ICICI Emeralde Private Metal:**
- 6 points per ₹200 spend (effectively 3 points per ₹100)
- Education capped at 1000 points per cycle
- Multiple exclusions for government, rent, fuel
- Up to ₹1 per point redemption value

## Major Architectural Migration (January 2025)

### 🚀 Pure AI System Implementation
- **Complete Regex Elimination**: Removed 300+ lines of complex regex intent detection

- **Intelligent System Prompts**: Comprehensive prompts with examples and calculation guidelines
- **Maintainability Focus**: Zero pattern maintenance required for new query variations

### 🎯 Key Improvements Achieved
- **Joining Benefits vs Fees**: Perfect distinction ("joining fee miles" → welcome benefits, not costs)
- **Milestone Calculations**: Complete breakdown (Regular: 24,000 points + Milestone: ₹6,000 vouchers)
- **Complex Query Handling**: Natural language understanding without pattern matching
- **Response Consistency**: All queries processed through unified AI system
- **Exclusion Accuracy**: Correct handling of category exclusions (education NOT excluded on Axis)

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage (21 Test Cases)  
Current metrics: Need to revalidate with AI engine
- Hotel/travel spending calculations
- Utility payment restrictions  
- Reward rate comparisons
- Insurance premium handling
- Government spending exclusions
- Education fee calculations
- Category-specific caps and limits
- Milestone bonus calculations
- Multi-category spending scenarios

### Testing Philosophy
- **Financial calculations** → Write tests first (accuracy is critical)
- **API endpoints** → Write tests after implementation
- **Edge cases** → Comprehensive coverage for Indian currency, card variations
- **User experience** → Test mobile interface and feedback system

### Code Completion Standards
- ✅ All linters pass with zero issues
- ✅ All tests pass (both automated and manual)
- ✅ Feature works end-to-end
- ✅ Old code is deleted
- ✅ Proper documentation on all functions

## Problem-Solving Framework

### When stuck or confused:
1. **Stop** - Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Step back** - Re-read the test cases and requirements
3. **Simplify** - The simple solution is usually correct
4. **Test** - Validate assumptions with `test_runner.py`
5. **Ask** - "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Currency Parsing Issues**: Check `_preprocess_currency()` method in AI engine
**Intent Detection Problems**: Review system prompts in `ai_powered_qa_engine.py`
**Data Access Issues**: Normalize JSON field names rather than updating prompts
**Test Failures**: Run `python test_runner.py` for detailed failure analysis

## AI Integration

### Pure AI System
- **Primary**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo/GPT-4
- **Fallback**: Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash)
- Environment variables: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

### System Prompt Engineering
- Include explicit instructions for finding rates in different JSON structures
- Provide concrete examples of rate extraction
- Never allow "no rate provided" responses when data exists
- Include conversation context for follow-up questions
- Detailed exclusion handling and mathematical accuracy requirements

## User Experience Features
